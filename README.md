<h1>Automating Security Tasks with Python</h1>
An important part of cybersecurity is controlling access to restricted content. In this turotial we'll develop an algorithm that parses a file containing IP addresses that are allowed to access restricted content and remove addresses that no longer have access.

<h2>Technologie Used</h2>

- Python

<p>
To start we will create 2 variables:

  1. import_file - which will hold our allow_list.txt (the file containing all the IP Addresses that are allowed access.
  2. remove_list - which is a list of all the IP Addresses no longer allowed access.
