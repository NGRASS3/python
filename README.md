<h1>Automating Security Tasks with Python</h1>
An important part of cybersecurity is controlling access to restricted content. In this turotial we'll develop an algorithm that parses a file containing IP addresses that are allowed to access restricted content and remove addresses that no longer have access.

<h2>Technologie Used</h2>

- Python

<p>
To start we will login to our Domain Controller DC-1 as an admin account, and our Client-1 as a normal user. Inside DC-1 we will create 4 new folders on the C:\ drive. 
  
  1. Read-Access
  2. Write-Access
  3. No-Access
  4. Accounting
